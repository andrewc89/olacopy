Using `xcopy`, pushes all backup files, in the same directory structure, to the destination directory.

### log
Full path of log file for `xcopy` output + date/time

### src

for the backup `sqlcmd`s + `\{name of your server}`.

### dest

## cleanBackups.cmd

Manages backup retention at the replication directory (i.e. deletes old backup files).
